# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Tom

I'm a developer focused on building clean, useful tools that solve real problems. My main focus is Python automation and workflow tools â€” recently I built **Tempest**, a desktop automation app for parsing Excel data and interacting with browser systems.

I also enjoy frontend design â€” check out my notes app, **Carrier**, for a themed in-browser UI built with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
